# stm32f429-vcp-appears-as-dfu
I am trying to receive some data from PC inside my MCu STM32F429IGT6 and send it back via USB Virtual COM Port.

I realized how to set up connection from embeded part and I even see connected device from Windows 10 Device Manager but... it appears as STM Device in DFU Mode

I have tryed already to install drivers from ST for such things but they are useless and official documentation says that they are not needed for Windows 10.

I have been following tutorials where guys just clicked several time inside Cube MX, generated code and VCP worked out of the box.

The question is what am I doing wrong?
